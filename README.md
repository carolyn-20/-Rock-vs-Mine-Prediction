# -Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This repository contains a Rock vs Mine Prediction model that classifies underwater sonar signals as either rock or mine using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of sonar signal readings, and the model helps in detecting underwater mines for defense and marine applications.

Features:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize sonar signal patterns
Feature selection & engineering to improve model accuracy
Classification models 
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
Model evaluation 

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)

ðŸ”— Dataset: Sonar Rock vs Mine Dataset 

Feel free to explore, test, and contribute! ðŸš€
